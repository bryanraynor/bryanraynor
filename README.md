- 👋 Hi, I’m @bryanraynor
- 👀 I’m interested in C# programming and Android Development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C# and Kotlin and looking to apply it to some basic programs to practice my skills.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing at the moment. Just looking to gain some practical experience before I start working on the 3 application ideas I have.
